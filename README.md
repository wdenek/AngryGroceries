Angry Groceries
==============

Angry Groceries is a web application to help people manage their grocery lists.
Our intend is to provide a simple, user friendly solution to keeping track of your groceries
together with your friends and family.

## Why this project?
There's two reasons we're building this. One, because we think that having a discussion 
with your wife over what should have been on the shopping list is uncool, especially since 
you weren't looking at the same shopping list to start with. 

Thee second reason we're building this is, because we want to learn more about modern web development.
We work on HTML, LESS, CSS, C#, ASP.NET and a lot of other MS technologies every day. You might think
we know how to build our websites. We do, but we think we can improve our skills and show others how to
build effective, modern web apps, by building this app.

So you get to watch us hack away at an awesome web application (At least we think it is).

## Used technologies
- ASP.NET MVC 5
- ASP.NET WebAPI 2
- OWIN
- jQuery
- AngularJS
- Twitter Bootstrap 3
- Specflow

## Notices
Please note: This is a work in progress. The development branch is our most recent work.
It **will** break, thank you ;-)

The main branch is our most stable version. Use that if you want something that compiles. Still, 
since this is a hack project, it could break on your machine. In that case, leave a ticket and we
will help you get things going.
